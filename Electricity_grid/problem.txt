The electricity grid and system is a very complex place. In this problem, consider a simplified 
system of a energy company needing to provide energy to each suburbs. 

There are 3 different energy generator with the following details:
Hydropump:      Capable of generating 2000 to 8000kW per hour. $5 operating cost applies for
                each kw of electricity generated.
Wind Turbine:   Capable of generating 500 to 3000KW per hour. $0.1 operating cost applies for 
                each kw of electricity generated.
Fossil Fuels:   Capable of generating 300 to 5000kW per hour. $10 operating cost applies for 
                each kw of electricity generated.

Additionally, when the electricity travels through the grid, each edge approximately loses 0.2%
of the input load per km. Finally for every kW sold, the company earns $13 of profit. Maximise
the profit while ensuring all suburb recieves the required amount of energy.
